								<h1>Overview</h1>
								<p>
									To draw a plan of automation introduction into the project and to understand, what should be automated, we need to define the follow:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>components, which the product consists of</li>
									<li>set of necessary cases;</li>
									<li>available cases (already written and used to test existed functionality);</li>
									<li>frequency of functionality changing</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									After defining all the points, described above, we can determine the entry point to start the introduction of automated testing.
									Trying to automate all at once is a faulty action, as it can lead to unstable, continuously changing tests, and permanent changes in the automation framework. As a result, QA Automation Engineer will spend all his time on bonding and reworking tests.
								</p>
								<h1>Stages and Activities</h1>
								<h1>Defining the product components</h1>
								<p> 
									Usually (but not always) a product consists of at least backend/server and client side (web client, desktop, mobile client, etc.). First of all, it's necessary to distinguish the key components* of the product, and to determine, which of such components are least available for direct manual testing.
									<blockquote>
										* Under key components we mean the parts, failure in which will impact on the efficiency of the product as a whole.
									</blockquote>
								</p>
								<p>
									Thus, we'll distinguish those parts of the product, which testing needs to be automated at first, as using automated tests will reduce risks of releases with high priority bugs. Typically, backend is a component, which tests should reasonably be automated first of all, because:
									<ul>
										<li>it is the integral point of failure;</li>
										<li>automated tests for backend are stable;</li>
										<li>backend is least available for direct manual testing.</li>
									</ul>
									<blockquote>
										UI, Mobile client and other product components' tests should be automated after backend tests
									</blockquote>
								</p>
								<h1>Test cases for automation</h1>
								<p>
									The next step is to specify and distinguish test cases, which should be implemented to automated cases. If there is a prepared set of tests for existed functionality already, the queue and priorities of test cases should be defined.
									In case of new functionality, which is on the design stage, or untested functionality, a test plan should be prepared.
								</p>
								<h1>Test plan creation</h1>
								<p>Test plan includes the following steps:</p>
								<ol>
 									<li>
 										Specifying of the required behavior of functionality
 										<br>
 											Functional behavior and basic use cases should be documented on the design stage by Project Manager.
 										</br>
 									</li>
 									<li>
 										Analysis of interfaces and protocol of new functionality, created by Architects and Developers on the stage of DEV Design
 									</li>
 									<li>
 										Thinking over of possible test methods, which can be useful for automated testing framework, and discussing them with Developers, if necessary.
 									</li>
 									<li>
 										Development of test cases for new functionality.
 									</li>
 									<li>
 										Division test cases on groups
 										<br>
 											Tests should be divided the way to make it possible to understand, which sets of tests should be automated first of all. As each project and functionality has its own specifics, first of all you need to use common sense and understand, what role for the Team and product these tests will play, when determine the importance of automation of any test.
 										</br>
 									</li>
 								</ol>
 								<p>Tests can be prioritized by different parameters:</p>
 								<ul>
 									<li>type of check;</li>
 									<li>test run frequency;</li>
									<li>data, used by test;</li>
									<li>amount of time on manual testing.</li>
 								</ul>
 								<p>The prioritization, proposed below, is general and can be varied, depending on specifics:</p>
 								<ol>
 									<li>
 										Acceptance tests - the first candidate on the automation, because they prove, that product component works through such protocol and interface, as other components of the product expect
 									</li>
 									<li>
										Priority regression tests
									</li>
									<li>
										Tests, that are hard to perform manually, and tests, taking a lot of time on manual testing
									</li>
									<li>
										Tests, that use large dataset
									</li>
									<li>
										Tests, using different dataset
									</li>
								</ol>
								<p>The following groups of tests should be chosen for automation first of all</p>
								<ol>
									<li>
										tests, which will help the Team to make decisions before releases quicker;
									</li>
									<li>
										tests, that will help developers to change the functionality, using these autotests as a tool to verify its performance;
									</li>
									<li>
										tests, which will help to rid QA Engineers from routine activities, save the time and spend it on more useful things
									</li>
								</ol>
